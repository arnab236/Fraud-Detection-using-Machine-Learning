# FinSight: Financial Transaction Fraud Detection

A data science project focused on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.  
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline — from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web application.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**FinSight** aims to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions based on historical data.  
The initial implementation uses a **Logistic Regression** model, with future plans to integrate **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Network** approaches for improved accuracy and robustness.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection.git
cd fraud-detection
````

### 2. Set up the environment

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Create this file manually if not present — see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below.)*

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Ensure your Kaggle credentials are configured for `kagglehub`, then run:

```bash
python dataset_from_kaggle.py
```

### 2. Model Training & Evaluation

You can open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis_model.ipynb
```

This will train the **Logistic Regression** model and save it (e.g., `model.joblib`).

### 3. Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run fraud_detection.py
```

Visit the displayed local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to interact with the model.

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset is obtained from **Kaggle**, containing anonymized features representing transaction patterns.
Each record is labeled as **fraudulent** (`1`) or **legitimate** (`0`).

---

## 🧩 Modeling Workflow

1. **Data Loading** — Using `kagglehub` to fetch data
2. **Preprocessing** — Scaling, encoding, and splitting using `scikit-learn` pipelines
3. **Model Training** — Logistic Regression baseline
4. **Evaluation** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC metrics
5. **Model Saving** — Using `joblib` for persistence
6. **Deployment** — Streamlit app for real-time inference
